**JS**
  - Arrow function vs function. What is `this`?
  - Var vs let vs const. What is hoisting?
  
**Angular**

  - Make all failing unit tests pass.
  - Add unit tests for add item workflow.
  - Refactor code - extract add item to component and add todos module.
  
**CSS**
  - Mark completed items with line through.
  - Create layout with fixed header and footer (add item button) and x-centered items with max width.
  - I there is a scroll bar, it should be only on the items.
